# "hulu 2.0" - clone full responsive movies app using Next.JS and Tailwind CSS

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project launch with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

My goal was to practice Next.js and discover the latest features of Tailwind CSS, the idea comes from one of Sonny Sangha tutorial.
